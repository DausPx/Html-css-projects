            <h2>Information about Amelia's life</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>She was born in Atchison, Kansas, in the home of her maternal grandfather, Alfred Gideon Otis (1827–1912), who was a former federal judge, 
                    the president of the Atchison Savings Bank and a leading citizen in the town. Amelia was the second child of the marriage after an infant was 
                    stillborn in August 1896. She was of part German descent. Alfred Otis had not initially favored the marriage and was not satisfied with 
                    Edwin's progress as a lawyer.</li>
                <li>A spirit of adventure seemed to abide in the Earhart children, with the pair setting off daily to explore their neighborhood.
                    As a child, Earhart spent long hours playing with sister Pidge, climbing trees, hunting rats with a rifle and "belly-slamming"
                    her sled downhill. Although the love of the outdoors and "rough-and-tumble" play was common to many youngsters, some biographers
                    have characterized the young Earhart as a tomboy.</li>
                <li>Sisters Amelia and Muriel (who went by her middle name from her teens on) remained with their grandparents in Atchison while their
                     parents moved into new, smaller quarters in Des Moines. During this period, the Earhart girls received home-schooling from their 
                     mother and governess. Amelia later recounted that she was "exceedingly fond of reading" and spent countless hours in the large 
                     family library.</li>
                <li>At about that time, Earhart and a young woman friend visited an air fair held in conjunction with the Canadian National Exhibition
                     in Toronto. One of the highlights of the day was a flying exhibition put on by a World War I ace. The pilot overhead spotted Earhart 
                     and her friend, who were watching from an isolated clearing, and dived at them. "I am sure he said to himself, 'Watch me make them scamper,'" 
                     she said. Earhart stood her ground as the aircraft came close. "I did not understand it at the time," she said, "but I believe that little red 
                     airplane said something to me as it swished by."</li>
                <li>Throughout the early 1920s, following a disastrous investment in a failed gypsum mine, Earhart's inheritance from her grandmother, 
                    which was now administered by her mother, steadily diminished until it was exhausted. Consequently, with no immediate prospects for 
                    recouping her investment in flying, Earhart sold the "Canary" as well as a second Kinner and bought a yellow Kissel "Speedster" 
                    two-passenger automobile, which she named the "Yellow Peril".</li>
                <li>Following her parents' divorce in 1924, she drove her mother in the "Yellow Peril" on a transcontinental trip from California with stops 
                    throughout the West and even a jaunt up to Banff, Alberta. The meandering tour eventually brought the pair to Boston, Massachusetts, 
                    where Earhart underwent another sinus operation which was more successful. After recuperation, she returned to Columbia University for 
                    several months but was forced to abandon her studies and any further plans for enrolling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
                    because her mother could no longer afford the tuition fees and associated costs.</li>
                <li>After Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, Amy Guest (1873–1959) expressed interest in being the first woman to fly 
                    (or be flown) across the Atlantic Ocean. After deciding that the trip was too perilous for her to undertake, she offered to sponsor the 
                    project, suggesting that they find "another girl with the right image". While at work one afternoon in April 1928, Earhart got a phone 
                    call from Capt. Hilton H. Railey, who asked her, "Would you like to fly the Atlantic?"</li>
            </ul>
